This is a thing I created with SDL and libtcod. It's not done yet. I don't think it will ever really be finished. That's OK though, because it's just a small thing I like to tinker with.

You'll need SDL 1.2.14 and libtcod 1.5.0.

Sometime in the future you'll need LUA, too. Oh, and a strong stomach for terrible code.

The goal of this project is simply to make a roguelike with a crafting element to it. Some really basic stuff doesn't work yet - like AI, combat, and proper dungeon generation - but I'm really proud of the dyanmic lighting system. How many other roguelikes out there have a dynamic lighting system?

Why a dynamic lighting system? To make pure-stealth gameplay possible. With other roguelikes you have to eventually hack and slash your way through to the end, but I wanted to give players the option of possibly being completely stealthy without having to rely on dice rolls to get you through.

Why crafting? Everyone is crafting nowadays. You can't get away from a game if it doesn't have crafting. I felt these crafting systems were too predictable and too bland - roguelikes are about fun, adventure, and bowing down to the RNG gods. So a "crafting" system exists (though shoddy at the moment) where players can combine two items into a third item that shares the attributes of each ... or, it creates something completely batshit insane, because that's what it does.

These two elements, I think, will be fundamental to the gameplay of RogueCraft.

Assuming, of course, I get around to adding gameplay to RogueCraft.
